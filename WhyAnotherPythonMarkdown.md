# Note: This project has been moved to [trentm/python-markdown2 on Github](https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2). #

There is already a [Python markdown implementation](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/Features). So why write another one?

  * I've run into some issues with `markdown.py`, some of which looked like fixing might be quite difficult. My initial attempts to email the maintainer ended up bouncing. At that point I started looking into a re-write. I've noticed now that `markdown.py` is [hosted on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-markdown/). (TODO: create issues there and link to them here.)

  * TODO: mention the safe\_mode thing and recent HTML sanitization discussions

  * For fun. Who doesn't like writing parsing code. :)
